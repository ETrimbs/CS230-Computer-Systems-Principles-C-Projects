Submission
You must submit the following to Gradescope by the assigned due date:

Makefile - the build file to use with the make program.
Source Files - source and header files that provide the interface and 
implementation of the solution to this project.
README.txt - this is a text file containing an overview/description of 
your submission highlighting the important parts of your implementation. 
You should also explain where in your implementation your code satisfies 
each of the requirements of the project or any requirements that you did not 
satisfy. The goal should make it easy and obvious for the person grading your 
submission to find the important rubric items. This text file should also clearly 
include a URL to your video for us to review. The video should not exceed 2 minutes 
in length and must provide a recorded voice to guide the viewer. 

You must use the VM environment to write your code. Make sure you submit 
this project to the correct assignment on Gradescope!
