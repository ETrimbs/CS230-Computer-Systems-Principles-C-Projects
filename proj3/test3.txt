Project Profile
The goal of this project is to complete the implementation of a program 
that performs a simple glossary analysis. In particular, the program extracts 
“words” from a text file and prints to the console a mapping of the words found 
in the provided text file and their associated frequencies. You can download a 
bunch of example book text files to help with your implementation. For example, 
a working implementation will produce the following output (assuming your 
compiled program is called wordfreak) given a sequence of text files from the 
command line:
